                <div>Hey there, I'm Neeraj, a passionate web developer with a love for crafting immersive digital
                    experiences.
                    My journey into the world of web development began with a curiosity for how websites are built.
                    Armed with determination and fueled by creativity, I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, eager to unlock the secrets of the digital landscape.</div>
        </section>
        <section class="second">
            <div>I honed my skills, I found myself drawn to the art of front-end development,
                relishing the challenge of bringing designs to life with clean, elegant code.
                From crafting responsive layouts to adding dynamic functionality,
                every project became an opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

        <section class="fourth">
            <div> Beyond coding, I find inspiration in the ever-evolving nature of technology and
                the endless possibilities it presents. Whether it's exploring new frameworks,
                experimenting with emerging trends, or simply diving into a sea of code,
